# Description:

    Overall Styling:

        The webpage uses the Tailwind CSS framework for styling and layout.
        Cards are used to organize and display different sections of content.
        It seems to be a user dashboard or profile page with options for signing in, viewing user details, and tracking daily progress.


        Section: Flexbox Card Layout:

            The section has a class of "flex flex-col sm:flex-row sm:flex-wrap items-center justify-center gap-2 bg-neutral-600 min-h-screen py-2 xl:relative."
            It's designed to create a card layout using Flexbox.
            Inside this section, there are three <div> elements, each representing a card.
            Each card is styled with various classes to control its appearance and positioning.

        A "Log out" link is provided.
        At the bottom, there are three icons, for navigating to different pages or sections.

    Card 3: Right Card - Daily Progress:

        This card seems to display daily progress or tasks.

        Each progress item has an icon, task name, and a right arrow for details.
